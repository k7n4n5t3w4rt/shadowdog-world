Talking with a new user in [Discord](https://discord.gg/Usjeqbyf7X) yesterday, we realised that the Free Plan quota of 600 seconds (10 minutes) per month CPU processing time on the server was not long enough. It doesn't really give someone long enough to try a few experiments _and_ see how something works in the wild for the rest of the month. We have updated the quota to 6000 seconds (100 minutes) which we think will be better. If you have any feedback or questions, please let us know.
