Story tokens for the whole first story - Shadowdog and the Dancing Robot - are available for anyone who follows https://www.instagram.com/5h4d0wd06/. The way it works is that I just send one of these story tokens to your Ethereum wallet address. If you already have wallet, that’s super simple. If you don’t, I can easily help you to set one up. It takes a few minutes and you don’t need anything special - it’s just a browser extension.

The point, finally, is that I would like to give away some of these story tokens to the people who have kept me going by tapping like and sometimes leaving comments. Actually I wouldn’t have kept going with Shadowdog if it wasn’t for your kind attention and support. Those little interactions have been very important to me.

If it all sounds a little crazy, that’s probably good :) I’ve gone pretty deep into NFTs lately. I think tokenisation on blockchains is going to change the way things are bought and sold online.

Of course, you can start following just now and still get a token. New followers are great too.

So! If you would like a token (and I really encourage you to get one even if the whole idea of NFTs is scary), please comment and I'll help you get set up. There's also a Discord channel if you're into Discord. It's an easier way to talk - https://discord.gg/EzDTZUQq8T

You can see the NFTs now on https://opensea.io/ - just search for "shadowdog and the dancing robot'
