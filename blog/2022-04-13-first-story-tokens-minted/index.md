Woohoo! The first story tokens have been minted. You can view them on [Opensea](https://opensea.io/collection/shadowdog-v1-0/).

Story tokens are the foundation of the Shadowdog creative model. When you hold a story token you become a custodian of Shadowdog. When I, and maybe others, make new Shadowdog products, royalties go back to story token holders. Also, token holders get a say in any new products.

Initially it is going to be very easy to get a story token so maybe there will be a staking process for them to weed out the people that don't really care.

For example, I have this idea that Shadowdog and the Dancing Robot would make a great film clip and I could collaborate with a musician to create one. That will be minted as an NFT. Story token holders will be part of the creative process - they will have a say in how it gets made. All the royalties (after the 10% gifted to the organisations we support and 5% for gas are deducted) will be distributed to story token holders based on how many story tokens they have staked.
