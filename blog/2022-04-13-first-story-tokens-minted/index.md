Woohoo! The first story tokens have been minted. You can view them on [Opensea](https://opensea.io/collection/shadowdog-v1-0/).

Story tokes are the foundation of the Shadowdog creative model. When you buy a story token you become a custodian of that story. When I make derivative products based on that story, royalties go back to the custodians of the story. Also, custodians get a say in any new derivative products that are made from the story.

For example, all these story tokens come from Shadowdog and the Dancing robot. I have this idea that it will make a great film clip and plan to collaborate with a musician to create one. That will be minted as an NFT that will be a derivative product of the story. Token holders for Shadowdog and the Dancing Robot will be part of the creative process - they will have a say in how it gets made. All the royalties (after the 10% gifted to the organisations we support and 5% for gas are deducted) will be distributed to story token holders based on how many story tokens they hold.
