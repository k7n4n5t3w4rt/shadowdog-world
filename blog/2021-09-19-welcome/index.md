Hello! This is not really a blog post - more of a placeholder for future blog posts about [Shadowdog](https://shadowdog.world) and related topics.

I guess I could say that we have a new communication channel, which is [Discord](https://discord.gg/Usjeqbyf7X). It's a chat server for anyone doing development with Shadowdog. All the maintainers of Shadowdog are there too, so it's the best place for questions. Also bugs and feature requests.

Thanks for stopping by. I hope you get good value out of Shadowdog. We love making it.
