# Story Tokens

Every Shadowdog story is minted as a series of story tokens. Holding a story token is like being a custodian of Shadowdog. I don't really know what that means in practice yet. Shadowdog is an experiment to find out what blockchain-enabled collective ownership of a digital brand might look like.

Story tokens are all minted on [the Shadowdog v1.0 smart contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x12fe6025acb2f2e42a5852b8495a6f70daa47443). That's how to know they're real. I can send a story token to your Ethereum wallet address. At the moment, the only criteria for getting one is being interested. If you'd like to join in the experiment, [let me know](https://twitter.com/5h4d0wd06). I can help you get set up with an Ethereum wallet and send you a story token.

There are currently [185 story tokens](https://opensea.io/collection/shadowdog-v1-0/).
