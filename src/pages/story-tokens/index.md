# Story Tokens

Every Shadowdog story is minted as a series of story tokens. Holding a story token is like becoming a custodian of Shadowdog. Other Shadowdog projects will also be minted as NFTs. For example, animated versions of the stories and collaborations.

This idea is still forming, but the plan is to distribute royalties from Shadowdog products and collaborations among people who hold and choose to stake story tokens. Royalties will flow back to story token holders in a way that is proportional to the number of tokens they have staked. Story token holders may also have a say in which products are made. Of course, story token holders will get swag and special utility that normal folks don't. I own all new story tokens. They will be minted on [the Shadowdog v1.0 smart contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x12fe6025acb2f2e42a5852b8495a6f70daa47443) and transferred to me. When you buy a story token, you buy it from me on the secondary market.

There are currently 185 story tokens. If you have one story token you can control 1 vote when it comes to decision-making processes regarding new creative products, which will be released as NFTs. When an NFT is sold, you receive 1/185 (that's one one-hundred-and-eighty-fifth) of the available royalties. By "available" I mean, whatever is left after collaborators, a percentage to cover costs (Ethereum gas fees, basically) and charities. All this will happen automatically using smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain - as far as possible. Some functions might not yet be supported by Ethereum and will happen on the Shadowdog platform.

This is all sounding a bit like terms and conditions. I should probably say this: I'm still working out the details and probably always will be. All of these arrangements and numbers will change. This is not a contract and, until some hypothetical time in the future when it might become a legal contract, you should make your decisions accordingly.
