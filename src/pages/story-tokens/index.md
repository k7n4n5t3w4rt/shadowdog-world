# Story Tokens

Every Shadowdog story is minted as a series of story tokens. Holding a story token is like becoming a custodian of Shadowdog. Other creative projects will also be minted as NFTs. For example, animated versions of the stories, collaborations and even Shadowdog projects make by other people.

Whenever a new creative product is sold as an NFT, people who hold story tokens for the story on which it is based will earn royalties. Royalties flow back to story token holders in a way that is directly proportional to the number of tokens they hold. They will also have a say in which products are made and how the royalties will be distribiuted. Again, the number of votes they have in this decision making process will be proportional to the number of tokens they hold. Some people might hold more than one story token, so they have proportionally more voting rights.

There are currently 185 story tokens. If you hold one story token, you have certain rights with regard to that story, along with up to 184 other token holders. You control 1 vote when it comes to decision-making processes regarding new creative products. When an NFT is sold, you receive 1/185 (that's one one-hundred-and-eighty-fifth) of the royalties available. If it's something I'm making that will be all the royalties minus some percentage for gas fees and the organisations Shadowdog supports.

10% of the royalties from sales of all Shadowdog NFTs, except story tokens, flow back to the organisations we decide to support. 5% goes to the Shadowdog contract to cover gas fees. The remaining 85% flows to the holders of story tokens. Collaborations will be different because a share will go to the collaborators.

Because I'm the originator of Shadowdog, some rights belong to me. By default, I own all new story tokens. They will be minted on the Shadowdog v1.0 smart contract and transferred to me. When you buy a story token, you buy it from me on the secondary market.

Of course, story token holders will get swag and special utility that normal folks don't.

All this happens automatically using smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain - as far as possible. Some functions might not yet be supported by Ethereum and will happen on the Shadowdog platform.

This is all sounding a bit like terms and conditions. I should probably say this: I'm still working out the details and probably always will be. All of these arrangements and numbers will change. This is not a contract and, until some hypothetical time in the future when it might become a legal contract, you should make your decisions accordingly.
