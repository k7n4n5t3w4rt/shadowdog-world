# Story Tokens

Every Shadowdog story is minted as a series of story tokens. Holding a story token is like being a custodian of Shadowdog. I don't really know what that means in practice yet. Shadowdog is an experiment to find out what blockchain-enabled collective ownership of a digital brand might look like.

There are currently 185 story tokens.

Maybe, if you have one story token you can control 1 vote out of 185 when it comes to decision-making processes regarding new creative products, which will be released as NFTs. These will be things like animations and film clips.

Maybe, when an NFT is sold, you will receive 1/185 (that's one one-hundred-and-eighty-fifth) of the available royalties. "Available" might mean whatever is left after collaborators take their share and percentages are reserved to cover costs (Ethereum gas fees, basically) and charities. As far as possible, qll this will happen using smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Some functions might not yet be supported by Ethereum and will need to be patched in somehow.

Maybe story token holders get swag and special “utility”.

I own all new story tokens. They are minted on [the Shadowdog v1.0 smart contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x12fe6025acb2f2e42a5852b8495a6f70daa47443) and transferred to me. I can send a story token to your Ethereum wallet address. At the moment, the only criteria for getting one is being interested. If you'd like to join in the experiment, [let me know](https://discord.gg/EzDTZUQq8T). I can help you get set up with an Ethereum wallet and send you a story token.
