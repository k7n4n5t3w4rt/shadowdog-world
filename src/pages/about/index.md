# About Shadowdog

What is it all about? I started drawing Shadowdog stories one frame a day on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/5h4d0wd06/) when I was out of work and locked down in 2020 due to COVID. I've been drawing and imagining Shadowdog, and his pal Oysterboy, for years. My brother, Tim, and I made up a whole bunch of stories once, but then life got in the way and we never did anything with them, but they're still there.

## Shadowdog DAO

It seems weird to be saying this because I've been imagining Shadowdog by myself for so long and I'm basically an introvert, but if Shadowdog is anything more than just my drawings, then it is a community. It takes a bunch of people with all sorts of skills and diversity to make something good. The characters and the stories are just the raw material.

I'm influenced by [Song A Day](https://songaday.world/) by Jonathan Mann. If he can do it with songs, I can do it with Shadowdog. That's the theory.

What do you want Shadowdog to be? Products? What kinds of products? A social enterprise? Should we animate the stories? That's what I imagine. I see them in 3D. What about a game? What about lots of games? Are you a musician? What does Shadowdog sound like?

Let's make everything we do into an artifact on a blockchain and have royalties from sales and derrivative work flowing back into the DAO. You become part of the DAO when you buy a token. Maybe different kinds of tokens bestow different powers. It's a work in progress. [Let me know what you think](https://discord.gg/EzDTZUQq8T).
