# About Shadowdog

I started drawing Shadowdog stories and posting on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/B-S21AgHzGJ/) when I was locked down in March 2020 due to COVID. I've been drawing and imagining Shadowdog, and his pal Oysterboy, for years.

When there's a new story in progress, I post a frame a day. I learned about [Song A Day](https://songaday.world/) by Jonathan Mann and it seemed similar. Johnathan uses NFTs to fund his work instead of Patreon or whatever, which got me thinking about NFTs. I'm planning to make each frame of each story into an NFT. I'm calling them "[story tokens](/story-tokens)".

The characters and the stories are like the raw material for other things I want to do. I plan to release each story as a web-zine (I may have made that up) and I'd like to make some physical products and lots of single frame animated gifs. Also some longer animations and collaborations.
