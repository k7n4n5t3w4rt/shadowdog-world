# About Shadowdog

Shadowdog is a webcomic and an art project. It's a prototype for what [I imagine] a digital brand might be like in the next decade or two.

I've been drawing and thinking about Shadowdog for years but I started posting stories, one frame per day, on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/B-S21AgHzGJ/) when I was locked down in March 2020.

Recently, I learned about NFTs and [Song A Day](https://songaday.world/) by Jonathan Mann. Johnathan uses NFTs to fund his work instead of Patreon or whatever. I wanted to explore that model for being a digial creator.

There are so many crazy aspects to NFTs right now, but over the next few years the hype will dissipate. Blockchains will enable new ways to [own things online](https://variant.mirror.xyz/T8kdtZRIgy_srXB5B06L8vBqFHYlEBcv6ae2zR6Y_eo). It will be boring and also profound. It will be normal to move your digital identity seamlessly across applications built on interoperable blockchain-based platforms. It will be easy to buy things and to support people and organisations.

I've started by making each frame of each story into an NFT. I'm calling them “[story tokens](/story-tokens)”. I'm giving them away to people who have been following Shadowdog on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/shadowdog.world/) and I'll probably put them up for sale soon. Probably right when everyone is totally over NFTs as a thing.

I have some projects in mind. I plan to make each story into a little stand-alone website that you can buy as an NFT - kind of like an online zine . I'd like to make some single frame animated gifs, and also some longer animations and film clips, either in collaboration with musicians or with my own music. I'll make all of them into limited edition NFTs.
