# About Shadowdog

I started drawing Shadowdog stories one frame a day on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/B-S21AgHzGJ/) when I was out of work and locked down in 2020 due to COVID. I've been drawing and imagining Shadowdog, and his pal Oysterboy, for years. My brother, Tim, and I made up a whole bunch of stories once, but then life got in the way.

When there's a new story in progress, I'm dong a frame a day. I learned about [Song A Day](https://songaday.world/) by Jonathan Mann. Instead of Patreon or whatever, I'm planning to make each frame of each story into an NFT. The idea is that buying a frame will give you a share in the ownership - the actual IP - of that story. When I draw an animated version, that will be a derivative product and any proceeds from it will flow back to the owners. It's blockchain and smart contracts all the way down. The way of the future.

Anyone will be able to propose derivative products. Let's say Netflix want to make a Shadowdog series. That would be a derivative product and all the owners of all the stories will get a chance to endorse it and share in the profits.

It takes a bunch of people with all sorts of skills and diversity of thinking to make something good these days. The characters and the stories are just the raw material. If Shadowdog is going to be anything more than just my drawings, then it will have to be a community.

What do you want Shadowdog to be? Should there be a zine? Products? Want to put your frame on a T-shirt and sell it? A social enterprise? Should we animate the stories? I see them in 3D. What about a game? What about lots of games? Collaborations with musicians?
