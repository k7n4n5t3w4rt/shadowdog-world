# About Shadowdog

Shadowdog is a webcomic and an art project. It's a prototype for what a digital brand might be like in the next decade or two.

I've been drawing and thinking about Shadowdog for years but I started posting stories, one frame per day, on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/B-S21AgHzGJ/) when I was locked down in March 2020.

When I learned about NFTs and [Song A Day](https://songaday.world/) by Jonathan Mann, I wanted to explore that as model for being a digial creator.

There are so many crazy aspects to NFTs right now, but over the next few years the hype - and the dispair - will dissipate. Blockchains will enable new ways to [own things online](https://variant.mirror.xyz/T8kdtZRIgy_srXB5B06L8vBqFHYlEBcv6ae2zR6Y_eo). It will be boring by then, but also profoundly, interestingly different from how we do things online now. It will be normal to move your digital identity seamlessly across applications built on interoperable blockchain-based platforms. It will be easy to buy things and to support people and organisations.

I'll be making each frame of each story into an NFT. I'm calling them “[story tokens](/story-tokens)”. I'm giving them away to people who have been following Shadowdog on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/shadowdog.world/). They're a way to be part of Shadowdog.

I have some projects in mind. I plan to make each story into a little stand-alone website that you can buy as an NFT - kind of like an online zine . I'd like to make some single frame animated gifs, and also some longer animations and film clips. I'll make all of them into limited edition NFTs.
