"In preparing for battle, I have always found that plans are useless, but planning is indispensable." -General Dwight D. Eisenhower.

## 10000 Tokens

I've been learning about NFTs and plan to release a bunch of Shadowdog tokens. I think it's an interesting kind of art. There's something about the scale of doing 10000 unique tokens that is very beautiful.

What are these tokens exactly? I'm still working that out. You could use them as a profile picture but they're probably not PFPs. PFPs need to be unique characters and you would be able to imagine a comic about each character (for example). These will be all Shadowdog. Or maybe they're all different Shadowdogs from different universes, like in Loki.

Whatever else, I imagine they will be an affordable way to show your support. Kind of like Patreon. Buying the token will keep me drawing new stories and give you a unique piece of Shadowdog. I also imagine there will be utility. I'm not sure what yet.

## Story Tokens

I'm plan to make each frame of each story into an NFT. The idea is that buying a frame will give you ownership of that story. Any decisions about what happens to it will be up to the owners. Let's say we make a Netflix series. In that case, we would have to get together to agree on how to do it or how much it should be worth. And how to take profits out individually and how much goes back into the DAO.
