# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

### Installation

```
$ npm i
```

### Local Development

```
$ npm start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Deployment

Because we're using GitHub we just push on the `main` branch.

This build static files to the `/docs` directory and GitHub pages serves them up.

```
npm run build
```
